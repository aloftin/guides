## Personas

Personas are used in the design process as a guide to create user experiences based on the types of users an application will have. A persona represents a demographic of people who will use the application. Typically, multiple personas are created before the design of an application takes place. The personas will help the designers to create different designs for the different types of users.

For example, if a team was building an application that handled membership and operations for a fitness club, then some of the users of the application might include front desk workers, salesmen, and personal trainers. The ages, mindset, and technical ability of these users might be very different. So the team would create a persona for each of these user types and include details about that user's job, skill level, goals, background, and a short description about that individual's day-to-day activities.
